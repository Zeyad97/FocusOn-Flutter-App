# FocusON Scores - Library Screen Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the main Library screen of the FocusON Scores music practice app. This is the central hub for PDF sheet music management with intelligent practice indicators.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Library Screen (`lib/screens/library/library_screen.dart`)
- **Grid and List View Modes**: Toggle between visual grid cards and compact list view
- **Smart Search**: Search by title, composer, or key signature
- **Multiple Sort Options**: Priority, title, composer, last opened, difficulty
- **Practice Status Indicators**: Visual readiness percentages and urgency alerts
- **Demo Data**: Sample pieces with realistic practice scenarios

### 2. Sophisticated UI Components

#### LibraryHeader (`lib/screens/library/widgets/library_header.dart`)
- Search bar with real-time filtering
- Sort dropdown with 5 sorting options
- View mode toggle (grid/list)
- Import PDF button

#### PieceCard (`lib/screens/library/widgets/piece_card.dart`)
- Readiness progress indicators (circular progress)
- Spot count badges (total, due, critical)
- Concert date urgency indicators
- Difficulty star ratings
- Last opened timestamps
- Responsive design for both grid and list modes

#### PracticeStatusBar (`lib/screens/library/widgets/practice_status_bar.dart`)
- Dynamic alert bar for urgent practice spots
- Critical vs. standard urgency indicators
- Direct "Practice Now" action button
- Gradient backgrounds based on urgency level

#### QuickActionChips (`lib/screens/library/widgets/quick_action_chips.dart`)
- Smart Practice (with urgent spot count badge)
- Critical Spots (red alert with count)
- Warmup, Quick Review, Performance modes
- Horizontal scrollable chip layout

#### ImportPDFDialog (`lib/screens/library/widgets/import_pdf_dialog.dart`)
- Professional file picker integration
- Metadata input form (title, composer, key signature)
- Difficulty slider with star visualization
- Optional concert date picker
- Loading states and error handling

### 3. Professional Design System
- **Color-coded Spot System**: Red (critical), Yellow (due), Green (ready)
- **Readiness Indicators**: Traffic light colors based on percentage
- **Concert Urgency**: Dynamic coloring based on days until performance
- **Consistent Theming**: Using AppTheme system throughout

### 4. Demo Data Structure
Generated realistic demo pieces:
- **Chopin Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2**: Concert in 14 days, multiple practice spots
- **Bach Invention No. 1**: Standard practice piece with green spots
- **Debussy Clair de Lune**: High-pressure concert piece with critical spots

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- Using Riverpod for scalable state management
- Local state for UI interactions (search, sorting, view mode)
- Prepared for database integration

### Data Flow
1. **Load Pieces**: From database service (currently demo data)
2. **Filter & Sort**: Real-time search and sorting
3. **Display**: Grid or list view with rich metadata
4. **Actions**: Import, practice, navigation

### Navigation Structure
- Tab-based navigation with 4 main sections
- Library is the primary tab (index 0)
- Placeholder screens for Projects, Practice, Settings

## Next Implementation Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **PDF Score Viewer**: Core feature for viewing and annotating sheets
2. **Spot Management**: Add/edit/delete practice spots on PDF pages
3. **Database Integration**: Replace demo data with SQLite persistence

### Advanced Features
