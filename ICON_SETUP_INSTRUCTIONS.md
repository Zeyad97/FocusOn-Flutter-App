# Quick Fix: Create App Icon

The issue is that you need to convert the SVG to PNG format. Here are the easiest ways:

## Method 1: Use Browser (Recommended)
1. Open `icon_converter.html` in any web browser
2. Right-click on the purple music icon
3. Select "Save image as..."
4. Save as `app_icon_1024.png` in the project root folder

## Method 2: Online Converter
1. Go to https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
2. Upload the file: `assets/images/app_icon_temp.svg`
3. Set output size to 1024x1024 pixels
4. Download and save as `app_icon_1024.png`

## Method 3: Use Paint/GIMP/Photoshop
1. Open `assets/images/app_icon_temp.svg` in any image editor
2. Export/Save as PNG at 1024x1024 resolution
3. Save as `app_icon_1024.png`

## After Creating PNG:
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

This will update your app icon on all platforms!

## Verify Icon Generation:
Check these folders after running the command:
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/` (Android icons)
- `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` (iOS icons)
